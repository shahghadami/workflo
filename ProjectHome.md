This is a thought-experiment with 3 main goals:

  * Learn ASP.NET MVC.
  * Become more familiar with LINQ to SQL.
  * Implement Workflow Foundation in a LOB application.

The vision for this app would be that it is installed and hosted at a customer site, and used as an internal intranet application for project management and issue tracking.
